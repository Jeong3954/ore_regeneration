# ore_regeneration
This is the source code of a Minecraft plugin I made called Ore Regeneration

How it works
1: Create a region using world guard
2: Open config and add the region under Regions:
3: Add the blocks you want that region to generate under blocks: 
4: Add the chance of the blocks under chances:

Here is an example

Regions:
  example:
    blocks: COAL_ORE,IRON_ORE,GOLD_ORE
    chances: 60,25,15
